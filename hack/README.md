# Terraform example

This is just for illustrative purposes. This module assumes you have
a running kubeflow instance on a cluster somewhere (you need to configure that).

This code deploys a Vault instance, creates a Storage Account, and deploys the
Applicaion.yaml file in order to launch the full gateway, along with auto-injection
and everything.
